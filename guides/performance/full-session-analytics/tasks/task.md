- Implement Core Web Vitals monitoring on this site using the `web-vitals` JavaScript library. The page should send the Core Web Vitals data to a collection endpoint at `/path/to/analytics/endpoint`, and it should wait to send the data until the user closes the tab or navigates away, to make sure the metric values are finalized before collecting. Follow modern web performance standards for full-session analytics beacon deferred requests, ensuring telemetry is queued reliably upon page unloading.
